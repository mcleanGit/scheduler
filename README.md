# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Project Purpose
Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

*Motivation.* As an executive leader for many years in higher-education and innovation in the performing arts and digital media, I am driven by the socio-economic, organizational, and technological impact of these transformative fields. Now that my institutional administrative role is completed, I am reengaged in many ongoing projects in interdisciplinary research and infrastructure development. In addition to their legacy value, some of those projects also explore new horizons, in part related to my role as co-founder of Digital Media at the Crossroads (DM@X) and other networking initiatives. I am motivated to expand my circle of influence and range of capability by working from the ground up, to explore the coding and implementation aspects of the digital present and future as an important complement to my executive experience in these areas. Although at this stage of my career I am more likely to be on the employer side of the hiring table, I am interested in developing my coding skills and perspective on this side of the industry. The current Work Day Scheduler application is part of that process.

The current Scheduler app, certainly in the form I have it here, would be quite inadequate as a real-life application. For one thing, in my previous professional role, the day's meetings routinely began at 8 am and concerts, normally about 5 evenings a week, did not end until after 10 pm. Accordingly, the Scheduler has been adjusted to encompass those hours, 0800-2200. It would also be necessary to flip between daily, weekly, and monthly schedules to be able to plan ahead, and reflect or review back. These elements are beyond the scope of this excercise.


## Aspects of the Project

The sequence of the application is as follows:
- the planner is opened in the browser
- the current day is displayed for extended business hours, to reflect my own experience
- the schedule presents hourly timeblocks
- the timeblocks are coded to indicate whether the hour is in the past grey, present--the current hour red--, or future green
- clicking a timeblock allows entry of text describing the event
- the save button at the right of each hourly timeblock saves the info in local storage
- so that the saved events persist when the page is refreshed

- note: I was unable to utilize the diskette save-icon in the right-hand column, despite using external resources and confirming that it was present in the added cdn resources. To review ?
- note: it would be beneficial to include a delete or clear button for individual hourly slots or for the day-page as a whole, as shown, but this functinaility has not yet been fully implemented here
- note: many difficulties arose from my decision to try to drive the HTML via JS, jQuery, and Moment.js. A good learning experience but it would, in hindsight, have been wiser to do most of the layout directly in the HTML, which would reduce the complexity of the JS and provide me with greater independence from often-contradictory external resources at this stage of my development.

The starter code uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time, but you're free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality because Moment.js is considered a "legacy" product. Learn more about these other solutions in the [Moment.js project status page.](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/).


## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
